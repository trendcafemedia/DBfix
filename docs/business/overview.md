## Comparison of Approaches

### GUI Desktop Application

- **Cons**: Ongoing hosting costs, security concerns with database uploads, internet dependency

A hybrid approach could be optimal:

1. **Initial Phase**: Develop the GUI desktop application first
   - Faster time to market
   - Lower initial investment
   - Builds brand recognition

2. **Second Phase**: Develop the SaaS offering
   - Use revenue from desktop app to fund development
   - Offer discounts to existing desktop customers
   - Provide migration path from desktop to web

3. **Final Phase**: Maintain both products with cross-promotion
   - Desktop app for users with offline/security requirements
   - SaaS for users who prefer convenience and automatic updates

## Next Steps

1. Finalize technical implementation of the core repair engine
2. Develop mockups and prototypes for the GUI application
3. Conduct market research and competitive analysis
