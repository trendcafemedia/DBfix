# SQLite Database Repair Tool Development Roadmap

This document tracks the development progress of the SQLite Database Repair Tool project. It will be updated whenever significant changes or improvements are made to the application.

## Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Engine Development (Completed)

#### March 5, 2025
- ✅ Analyzed existing repair scripts (imessage_repair.py and malfix.py)
- ✅ Created comprehensive script analysis document
- ✅ Designed and implemented advanced_db_repair.py combining functionality of both scripts
- ✅ Added multiple repair strategies with intelligent selection
- ✅ Implemented detailed logging and reporting (HTML and JSON)
- ✅ Added command-line interface with multiple options
- ✅ Created project documentation (README.md)
- ✅ Developed business plans for GUI and SaaS versions
- ✅ Created detailed SaaS implementation assessment with code examples

### Phase 2: GUI Development (Planned)

#### Short-term Goals (1-2 months)
- [ ] Select GUI framework (PySide6 recommended)
- [ ] Create mockups and wireframes for the interface
- [ ] Implement basic interface with database selection and repair options
- [ ] Add database preview functionality
- [ ] Implement progress indicators for repair operations
- [ ] Create visualization of database structure

#### Medium-term Goals (2-4 months)
- [ ] Implement wizard interface for common operations
- [ ] Add advanced mode for technical users
- [ ] Create before/after comparison views
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple databases
- [ ] Add user settings and preferences
- [ ] Create installer for easy distribution

#### Long-term Goals (4-6 months)
- [ ] Implement licensing system for commercial version
- [ ] Add tiered feature restrictions based on license
- [ ] Create update mechanism
- [ ] Implement usage analytics (opt-in)
- [ ] Add help documentation and tutorials
- [ ] Prepare for commercial launch

### Phase 3: SaaS Development (In Progress)

#### Initial Planning (Completed)
- ✅ Designed architecture for web-based version
- ✅ Created subscription tier model
- ✅ Identified technical challenges and solutions
- ✅ Assessed implementation capabilities for key components
- ✅ Created code examples for API, backend, and frontend
- ✅ Determined WordPress integration strategy
- ✅ Created detailed WordPress integration plan document

#### Implementation Goals
- [ ] Set up cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Develop API for database operations
- [ ] Create user authentication system with WordPress integration
- [ ] Implement subscription management
- [ ] Develop standalone web frontend
- [ ] Create asynchronous processing system
- [ ] Implement security measures for database uploads
- [ ] Add interactive reports and visualizations
- [ ] Develop WordPress connector plugin

#### WordPress Integration Approach
- [ ] Build core application as standalone web app
- [ ] Host on subdomain or separate hosting
- [ ] Create WordPress plugin for authentication bridge
- [ ] Implement consistent styling across platforms
- [ ] Configure secure API communication between systems

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on two parallel tracks:

### Track 1: GUI Development
1. Testing the advanced_db_repair.py with various corruption scenarios
2. Creating detailed mockups for the GUI interface
3. Setting up the development environment for GUI implementation
4. Conducting market research on competing products

### Track 2: SaaS Backend Development
1. Developing the API specification in OpenAPI/Swagger format
2. Adapting the repair engine for web service use
3. Creating infrastructure-as-code configurations
4. Implementing the core backend services
5. Designing WordPress integration components

## Next Update Expected

The next roadmap update will occur when GUI development begins or when significant improvements are made to the core repair engine.
